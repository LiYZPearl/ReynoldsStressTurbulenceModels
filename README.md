# ReynoldsStressTurbulenceModels (RSM)
Reynolds stress turbulence closure models beyond the Boussinesq approximation

The RSM in terms of the Wilcox (2006) stress-omega model is implemented with an additional buoyancy production term for simulating multiphase flows. 
Test cases including a turbulence wave boundary layer simulation (Jensen et al. 1989, there Test 13) and a spilling breaking wave simulation (Ting & Kirby 1994, 1996) are provided.

The paper regarding the formal analysis and applications of the Wilcox (2006) stress-omega model has been submitted to the Journal of Fluid Mechanics.
